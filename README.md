Bank Marketing - Predicting Customer Purchase with Decision Tree

Objective:
The aim of this project is to build a decision tree classifier that predicts whether a customer will purchase a product or service. This prediction is based on various demographic and behavioral data collected from customers. The project utilizes the Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Key Features:
- *Customer Data*: The dataset contains customer demographics like age, job, marital status, education, as well as behavioral factors such as the number of contacts and the success of previous marketing campaigns.
- *Decision Tree Algorithm*: The decision tree is used to create a model that classifies whether a customer will respond positively to a marketing campaign.
- *Model Evaluation*: After training the classifier, its performance will be assessed with evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Tools and Libraries:
- *Python*: The programming language for data manipulation, model building, and evaluation.
- *Scikit-learn*: A key library for implementing machine learning algorithms, including decision trees.
- *Pandas*: Used for data preprocessing, cleaning, and manipulation.
- *Matplotlib & Seaborn*: For visualizing the data and the decision tree model.
- *Jupyter Notebook/Colab*: For coding, testing, and documenting the workflow interactively.

Conclusion:
This project results in a decision tree classifier that can predict the likelihood of a customer purchasing a product or service. By analyzing the demographic and behavioral factors in the dataset, we can gain valuable insights into customer behavior, which can be used to improve marketing strategies and targeting efforts.
